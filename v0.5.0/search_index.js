Each point in the diagram is first transformed into birth, persistence coordinates. Then, it is weighted by a weighting function and widened by a distribution (default: gaussian with σ=1). Once all the points are transformed, their distributions are summed together and discretized into an image.\n\nThe weighting ensures points near the diagonal have a small contribution. This ensures this representation of the diagram is stable.\n\nOnce a PersistenceImage is constructed (see below), it can called like a function to transform a diagram to an image.\n\nInfinite intervals in the diagram are ignored.\n\nConstructors\n\nPersistenceImage(ylims, xlims; size=5, kwargs...)\nPersistenceImage(diagrams; size=5, kwargs...)\n\nArguments\n\nylims, xlims: Limits of the square on which the image is created, both 2-tuples. Note that y comes first as this is the way arrays are indexed.\ndiagrams: Collection of persistence diagrams. This constructor sets ylims and xlims according to minimum and maximum birth time and persistence time. Sets slope_end to maximum persistence time.\n\nKeyword Arguments\n\ndistribution: A function or callable object used to smear each interval in diagram.  Has to be callable with two Float64s as input and should return a Float64. Defaults to a normal distribution with sigma equal to 1.\nsigma: The width of the gaussian distribution. Only applicable when distribution is unset.\nweight: A function or callable object used as the weighting function. Has to be callable with two Float64s as input and should return a Float64. Should equal 0.0 for x=0, but this is not enforced.\nslope_end: the y value at which the default weight function stops increasing.\nsize: integer or tuple of two integers. Determines the size of the array containing the image. Defaults to 5.\n\nExample\n\ndiag_1 = PersistenceDiagram(0, [(0, 1), (0, 1.5), (1, 2)])\ndiag_2 = PersistenceDiagram(0, [(1, 2), (1, 1.5)])\nimage = PersistenceImage([diag_1, diag_2])\n\n# output\n\n5×5 PersistenceImage(\n  distribution = PersistenceDiagrams.Binormal(1.0),\n  weight = PersistenceDiagrams.DefaultWeightingFunction(1.5)\n)\n\nimage(diag_1)\n\n# output\n\n5×5 Array{Float64,2}:\n 0.266562  0.269891  0.264744  0.251762  0.232227\n 0.294472  0.297554  0.291244  0.276314  0.254244\n 0.31342   0.316057  0.308664  0.292136  0.268117\n 0.32141   0.323446  0.315164  0.297554  0.272373\n 0.31758   0.318928  0.310047  0.29199   0.266562\n\n\n\n\n\n","category":"type"},{"location":"#PersistenceDiagrams.jl-1","page":"Home","title":"PersistenceDiagrams.jl","text":"","category":"section"},{"location":"#","page":"Home","title":"Home","text":"This package provides the PersistenceInterval and PersistenceDiagram types as well as some functions for working with them.
