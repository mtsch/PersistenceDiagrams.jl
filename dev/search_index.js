Each point in the diagram is first transformed into birth, persistence coordinates. Then, it is weighted by a weighting function and widened by a distribution (default: gaussian with σ=1). Once all the points are transformed, their distributions are summed together and discretized into an image.\n\nThe weighting ensures points near the diagonal have a small contribution. This ensures this representation of the diagram is stable.\n\nOnce a PersistenceImage is constructed (see below), it can called like a function to transform a diagram to an image.\n\nInfinite intervals in the diagram are ignored.\n\nConstructors\n\nPersistenceImage(ylims, xlims; size=5, kwargs...)\nPersistenceImage(diagrams; size=5, kwargs...)\n\nArguments\n\nylims, xlims: Limits of the square on which the image is created, both 2-tuples. Note that y comes first as this is the way arrays are indexed.\ndiagrams: Collection of persistence diagrams. This constructor sets ylims and xlims according to minimum and maximum birth time and persistence time. Sets slope_end to maximum persistence time.\n\nKeyword Arguments\n\ndistribution: A function or callable object used to smear each interval in diagram.  Has to be callable with two Float64s as input and should return a Float64. Defaults to a normal distribution with sigma equal to 1.\nsigma: The width of the gaussian distribution. Only applicable when distribution is unset.\nweight: A function or callable object used as the weighting function. Has to be callable with two Float64s as input and should return a Float64. Should equal 0.0 for x=0, but this is not enforced.\nslope_end: the y value at which the default weight function stops increasing.\nsize: integer or tuple of two integers.
